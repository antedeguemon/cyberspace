Hey there! My name is Vicente Merlo. I live in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul. I work as a Software Engineer and I have been programming in Elixir for the last couple of years.

My main interests are functional programming languages and distributed systems.

Apart from computers I am into Rubik's cubes and playing with my dogs, Tesla and Samira.
